<a href=https://twitter.com/followgray_>Giray Demirel</a></p><img src=/img/thumb-1920-573305.jpg class=welcome-img><h1 id=introduction><strong>Introduction</strong></h1><p>Dives Research is an organization that mainly focuses on analyzing blockchain
ecosystems and the financial markets. Although the crypto trend over the recent
years has taken the attention of the masses, it created huge trends with tons
of projects that lack proper ideas and solutions. Seperating good projects from
the bad ones is important more than ever, thus we aim to create detailed and
specific publications that result from deep research of the concerning ideas.</p><h1 id=who-are-we><strong>Who are We</strong></h1><p>Dives Research consists of multi-disciplinary and enthusiastic people that share
a background in mixtures of software development, research, investing, and
trading.</p><p>Although we are going public just right now, we have been privately conducting
research and investing activities in an organized way since 2020. The scope of
these activities mainly includes:</p><ul><li>Building algorithmic tools (such as AMMs, Arbitrage bots, listing bots, etc.)</li><li>Building Investment strategies that are both based on fundamental blockchain
analysis as well technical price analysis</li><li>Gem-hunting (Hunting airdrops, Chasing ICO/IDO opportunities, and so on)</li></ul><h1 id=our-philosophy><strong>Our Philosophy</strong></h1><p>Since it is easy to get carried away without proper principles in the crypto
ecosystem, we sincerely believe every investor should act in line with a
certain philosophy. This applies to content-creators and developers as well as
they affect masses through their products.</p><p>As Dives Research, we embrace the following principles:</p><p><strong>Sustainability over hype:</strong> As blockchain ecosystems are in rapid-continuous
development, filtering projects and spotting the ones with promising long-term
ideas is as important as analyzing the latest significant technologies and
projects in this field. Rather than just benefiting from short-term projects, we
value the ideas that have the potential to create impactful solutions in the
<strong>long-term</strong>.</p><p><strong>Simplicity:</strong> Few crypto projects involve a complexity inherent to
their nature, but most seem to inherit a complexity that is more than
required (see [complexity][complexity]). As the number of dependencies
and layers in a project increases, so does the probability of the
occurrence of a problem. We value simple solutions over complex ones, we
see value in being able to understand the tools that are important for
this ecosystem to perform. We want to simplify things.</p><p><strong>Risk Taking and Management:</strong> We are not afraid of taking risks, but we also
think it is stupid to underestimate the risks involving crypto. Understanding
and acting in accordance with a good understanding of concepts such as Portfolio
Management, Risk Reward Ratios are crucial for success as well as good
research. Do not expect from us to share crypto &ldquo;insights&rdquo; for your
shitcoins.</p><p><strong>Openness:</strong> Different actors such as financial markets, central banks, and the
crypto sector relate with each other. This creates different
opportunities in many fields. Hence, we do not like to restrict
ourselves to specific domains, instead we tend to analyze the market as
a whole while evaluating different types of opportunities.</p><p><strong>Transparency:</strong> Most projects dedicate their marketing and strategy
departments to this specific task of hyping people up and taking advantage of
their ignorance. We are tired of witnessing people whose only function in crypto
is to take advantage of others&rsquo; less knowledge. We aim to do the OPPOSITE and be
transparent on all our major steps.</p><h1 id=services-offered><strong>Services Offered</strong></h1><p>Apart from the content that we publicly publish to contribute to the ecosystem,
we offer one-to-one services. These services include;</p><p><strong>Analysis Reports:</strong> We research and prepare reports depending on your specific
needs;</p><ul><li><strong>Project Research</strong> : We prepare a report that evaluates fundamental metrics
of a project such as tokenomics, competitors, team members, uniqueness of the
value it proposes and how it does it, and so on.</li><li><strong>Risk Analysis</strong> : We evaluate the risks of specific protocols using our
risk models and evaluate them with a different range of parameters.</li><li><strong>Market/Ecosystem Condition:</strong> We also analyze & report the market
conditions or condition of a specific ecosystem.</li><li><strong>Backtesting Trading Strategies:</strong> We can backtest your trading
strategy and give results to you at a cost <em>as long as</em> your strategy is
well-defined.</li></ul><p><strong>Content Creation:</strong> If you want your project to be analyzed by us
publicly, we can create and publish content about your project.</p><p><strong>Project Advisementship:</strong> We advise projects and help them to achieve
their impactful ideas by assessing their current situation and advising
on topics ranging from tokenomics to risk management.</p><p><strong>Algorithmic Tools:</strong> We build algorithmic solutions for your problems
that can be automated.</p><p>If you are interested, please contact us at <a href=mailto:xxx@divesresearch.com>xxx@divesresearch.com</a></p></article><aside><center><h1 style=margin-top:1rem>Author(s)</h1><div class=author-bar><a href=https://twitter.com/kugurerdem><img class=author-bar-photo src=/img/ugur.jpg alt=ugur></a>
